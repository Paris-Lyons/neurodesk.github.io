## Windows users: WSL not installed properly

The Docker engine relies on the Windows subsystem for Linux ([WSL]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)) to run on a Windows machine. 

{{< alert title="Note" >}}We recommend the _manual_ install instructions, as the simplified install requires an upgrade to a preview build of Windows that may be unstable.{{< /alert >}}

If WSL is properly installed, the _Resources_ tab of the Docker settings should look something like this:

![Docker_WSL_correct](/Docker_WSL_correct.png 'Docker_WSL_correct')

However, if WSL is missing or incorrectly configured, the _Resources_ tab of the Docker settings may look something like this:

![Docker_WSL_incorrect](/Docker_WSL_incorrect.png 'Docker_WSL_incorrect')

If this is the case, follow the manual install instructions to install [WSL 2]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (including installation of Ubuntu through Microsoft Store). 

## Not enough free space on the partition in Windows and WSL2
